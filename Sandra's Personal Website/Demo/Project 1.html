            Preparation: Building the Printer
        </h2>

                <p> 
                    As this was my first time building any type of 3D Printer, I entered the assembly process with an open mind. Inside the packaged
                    box was a collection of all needed tools, including two partially built components. The circuitry, to the left, came 
                    preassembled and would help control the X and Z axis of the printer. The heated plate would move on the Y axis. <br><br>

                    A 3D object exists in the X,Y, and Z plane so to create something from nothing, the printer will have to build upon these axes.
                    The Prusa Mini+ Instruction Manual provided detailed explanation combining various visual aids. Using lists, model images, and corresponding 
                    arrows with colors, it was quick to determine what parts matched where. However, some steps of the assembly were more difficult, or unpredictable, 
                    than expected.  
                </p>

            My partner and I were aware of the delicate parts on the circuit board; part of maintaining that care is ensuring wires aren't bent at awkward angles 
            or forcibly plugged in, potentially causing irreparable damage. Although the instructions were clear, we were uncomfortable with how the LCD cable was
            entering the circuit box. I would have adjusted the opening into the box by centering it with the LCD cable port in order to prevent any bent wires or
            tight angles for insertion. This change would actually be feasible since the Prusa Mini+ has inherent parts that were also 3D printed, including the circuit box, 
            highlighting the versatility and usability of any 3D printed product.

                    The next tricky part of the assembly was lining up the Y-axis assembly, the heatbed, with the vertical XZ-axis assembly.
                    This is when the instructions became less clear as we had to line up opposing holes, insert a screw, and tighten it with little to no visibility on where 
                    the holes were and how far in the screw was. If I were to change this part of the assembly process, I would have different-colored markings on the XZ and Y-axis parts 
                    to help users match what holes line up with one another and where on the printer they should be located.<br><br>
                    
                    After this point, many of the instructions were straightforward. We prepared the remaining LCD parts and connected the Y-axis motor to the circuit board, which would allow the heatbed 
                    to move during the printing process in order to reach different parts of the build. Next was the filament sensor, which we had to securely push onto the PTFE tube, a type of transparent and flexible tubing that would allow easy passage 
                    for the printing filament. Although slightly difficult to properly determine if the tube was fastened properly, the manual provided ways for us to check both visually and by feel.<br><br> 

                    Rearranging the wires, covering the circuit box, and assembling the filament spool holder was all that was left before we had our completed Prusa Mini+ 3D Printer! The spool holder was extremely simple as 
                    it was merely two tracks, each one containing two wheels, that could be adjusted to accomodate varying spool sizes. Filament needs to be properly loaded before printing, but during the printing process, the spool needs to easily unravel in order to have sufficient material. 
                    I would have preferred a spool holder that would hold the filament perpendicular to the ground, allowing the filament to work with gravity as it's pulled. This would limit the risk of filament getting tangled in the spool or not being pulled into the printer.
                    <!-- --ON PRINTING - need to highlight how the printer may not pick up the filament properly, so you print air and waste materials
                    (have the gif example highlighting what happened to it)  -->

            Printing: Using the PrusaSlicer Software

                    To become familiar with the printer's operating capabilites, we had to begin a print. Starting with the #3DBenchy tugboat, also known as "the 
                    jolly 3D printing torture test", is a good way for us to determine if the printer is operating as expected while testing its production limits. The 
                    end goal is using these to prints to adjust hardware and software settings for optimal results.<br><br>

                    was an initial non-understanding of where the print was coming from (just loaded in whatever was on the joystick)
                    
                    Prusa Slicer is how we transition from CAD to CAM, slicing the object into tangible and workable parts that the computer can then

                As a first print, we can tell our printer was callibrated well since the tugboat came out moderately clean. In the gif, there is a thin stripe of filament along the outer 
                portion of the heatbed. That semi-flat adhesion is what my partner and I were looking for as this tells us the filament is not sticking too much or too little to the surface. 
                If the extruded filament looks squashed and wide, the z-axis is too low. If the extruded filament doesn't stick to the heatbed or it can be easily picked off, then our z-axis is 
                too high and the filament doesn't have enough area to adhere to a surface. The gif shows a good start to the first layer, with the letter details becoming apparent and the filament 
                adhering well around the shape. <br><br> 

                However, when completed, our print showed signs of stringing; this is faintly shown in the photo above. Also known as oozing, it's when small strings of plastic are left on the 3D model as a result of the extruder moving to 
                various locations. Some possible causes for this is that the temperature is too high for the filament. We used PLA for this model and printed with the extruder at 215 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is too high, it's much easier 
                for plastic to leak out, especially as the extruder moves to different areas of the build. Another probable cause is the nozzle's retraction speed. During assembly, we had difficulty ensuring the printer was grabbing the filament from the 
                gear and feeding it into the PTFE tube connected to the extruder. Since we already faced problems with the gear pre-printing, it may have moved too fast or slow when picking up filament and may have ground away small pieces, thus affecting 
                the retraction speed.

                    The general workflow for 3D printing is going from CAD (computer-aided design) to CAM (computer-aided manufacturing). The CAM portion is when the print is being made in the 3D printer.
                    The CAD portion is all of the software relevant to the design and model pre-processing. Although we didnt create the 3DBenchy model ourselves, we did have to use the PrusaSlicer software in order to 
                    see how the tugboat would be built to analyze any glaring issues in structural integrity.<br><br>
                    Slicing a 3D model means converting the model file (such as .OBJ or .STL) into machine language that the printer
                    can recognize. Pictured is the original settings for the 3DBenchy model, in which our <b>gyroid infill was set to 15% and the layer height was 0.2mm.</b> Our print time was 1hr 16 minutes.<br><br>

                    For the sake of experimentation, we wanted to print the 3DBenchy model as fast possible in as little time while still maintaining the model's integrity. Other than making the model itself, the two parts of a build
                    that take the most time are any necessary supports and infill.  <b>We reduced the infill to 10% and changed it to a rectilinear formation.</b> Gyroid is the default infill style for PrusaSlicer since it's 3 dimensional, allowing 
                    equal strength in 3 directions, and prints relatively fast. Rectilinear is one of the fastest printing infills and only goes in one direction; it was a definite risk to reduce this infill percentage since the style isn't as durable. 
                   <b>We also increased the layer height to 0.39mm.</b> Modifying the layer height affects the resolution, surface finish, and print accuracy on smaller parts; the bigger the height difference between layers, the less time the printer takes to secure each layer.
                    <b>Our print time was reduced to 49 minutes.</b><br><br> 

                    Below are some photos highlighting the differences between the two builds as well as an inside look of the 3DBenchy model and the infill style contained inside. 
                    Notice the print quality between the two, specifically in the lack of detail and how apparent the lines are.

            Project Conclusions
        </h2>

        <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px;">
            Overall, this project was extremely fun and provided valuable insight into the design and manufacturing steps needed to create a 3D build. Learning about what components of the 3D printer 
            connected to where was helpful for understanding how the print would come to fruition via additive manufacturing. I definitely expected starker differences between our first and second builds 
            since I felt my partner and I modified key components that would have greater effects on not only time, but also print quality.<br> 
            In the future, I would like to see what settings would "break" the 3DBenchy model and would provide a barely usable print. This would help determine the printer's speed and accuracy limits, and right now, 
            I feel we have only scratched the surface.
